----------------------------
Version 0.0.4, 07 February 2015

The latest version supports:
Compatible with Reason 5 / Record 1.5 to Reason 6.5.3 - may work with future versions too.
Kong pads - turn off CC and PROG CHANGE, then Pad Bank 1 maps to Kong pads 1-8, Pad Bank 2 maps to pads 9-16.
Switches - turn on CC and each pad will act as a switch. Pad Bank 1 maps to switches 1-8, Pad Bank 2 maps to switches 9-16. Note that 'toggle' mode for the switches does not work correctly, and probably never will, so the pad lights will not stay lit.
Prog Change - turn on PROG CHANGE and each pad will generate push-button events. Currently these are set up to send Transport messages:

1 - Play
2 - Stop
3 - Record
4 - Loop
5 - Tap tempo
6 - Add overdub
7 - change to previous sequencer track
8 - change to next sequencer track
